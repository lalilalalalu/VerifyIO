## VerifyIO

High-performance computing (HPC) applications generate and consume substantial amounts of data, typically managed by parallel file systems. These applications access file systems either through the POSIX interface or by using high-level I/O libraries. While the POSIX consistency model remains dominant in HPC, emerging file systems and popular I/O libraries increasingly adopt alternative consistency models that relax semantics in various ways, creating significant challenges for correctness and portability. This paper addresses these challenges by proposing a trace-driven I/O consistency verification workflow, implemented in our open-source tool, VerifyIO. VerifyIO collects execution traces, detects data conflicts, and verifies proper synchronization against specified consistency models. Our extensive evaluation of 91 test case executions across three widely-used I/O libraries against four I/O consistency models reveals critical consistency issues at both the application and implementation levels.
